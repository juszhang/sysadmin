1. Recover root password
   A method (prior to REHL7):
   Grub > e
   init=/bin/sh (Remove rhgb and quiet tags if necessary) > Ctrl+x
   /usr/sbin/load_policy -i
   mount -o remount,rw /
   passwd
   mount -o remount,ro /
   
   B method (RHEL7&8):
   Grub > e
   rd.break > Ctrl+x
   chroot /sysroot
   mount -o remount,rw /
   passwd
   touch /.autorelabel
   exit
   reboot/exit

   NOTE: The ‘rd’ part of ‘rd.break’ refers to ramdisk— the initial ramdisk (initrd) environment.

2. Network config
   after modify /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-<interface name>. run ifdown <connection name> && ifup <connection name> to make it take effect
   If you may get like "no active connection provided", check your connections first:
   to list your connections and devices, run
   nmcli con
   nmcli dev

   Note: ifup/ifdown uses NetworkManager, which in turn uses the concept of "connection". You don't have a connection for a interface, for example, enp0s8, you get an error

3. the -hosts map in autofs
      1). /net -hosts -nobrowse
          The most widely used hierarchical mount is the builtin -hosts map, which mounts all exported filesystems from a named host.

4. lvm trouble shouting
   1). Problem
      # parted /dev/sdb print
        Error: /dev/sdb: unrecognised disk label
        Model: ATA VBOX HARDDISK (scsi)
        Disk /dev/sdb: 1074MB
        Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
        Partition Table: unknown
        Disk Flags:

        Solution:
        # parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt

    2). Problem
        # pvcreate /dev/sdb
          Device /dev/sdb excluded by a filter.
        
        Solution:
          # wipefs -a /dev/sdb
            /dev/sdb: 8 bytes were erased at offset 0x00000200 (gpt): 45 46 49 20 50 41 52 54

          # pvcreate /dev/sdb
              Physical volume "/dev/sdb" successfully created.
