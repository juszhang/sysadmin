Vim does show ^M except in one case: if the fileformat=dos then it will not show a trailing crlf.

You can find out which format (unix or dos) you have by typing :set and you can get rid of the ^M 
in the crlf by just changing the format (:set fileformat=unix) and then writing out the file.

Display CRLF as ^M:
:e ++ff=unix

Substitute CRLF for LF:
:setlocal ff=unix
:w
:e

explaination: 
:e ++ff=unix uses the :edit command to load the file again from disk, specifically with the unix file format: ++ff=unix. :setlocal I believe sets a local options just for this vim window, ensuring that file format is set to unix: ff=unix. :w writes the file to disk. :e loads the file from disk again to display the current state of the file

vim is autodetecting the fileformat and switching modes to match (take a look at set ff)

If you want to force it to open in a particular mode, toss a +ff=unix(to show the ^M) or +ff=dos in your command line to open it in that mode. If you're on a windows box, just try :e ++ff=unix after opening the file.

If you're trying to just strip those characters out, you can open it in one mode, set the ff to what you want, and then save the file. Check out :h ff for more details.
