If you have started the process without using "screen" command then you cannot take over that process. Basically you cannot take over a process that was started in a different shell.

When your session is terminated all the bg process will go the detached state. Though you might be able to see the details of such process you cannot fg them to a shell from login afterwards

If a process has been orphaned, you can't "reparent" it to a different shell and use fg, bg, ^Z, ^C, and so forth to control it.

Example, 
you start a process at background:
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &
and then you close the terminal. the dd process will be orphaned and you cannot bring it to the foreground in a new terminal
