To see the nice values of processes, we can use utilities such as ps, top or htop:

$ ps -e -o pid,ppid,ni,comm

2. 
Difference Between PR or PRI and NI
From the top and htop outputs above, you’ll notice that there is a column called PR and PRI receptively which shows the priority of a process.

This, therefore, means that:

NI – is the nice value, which is a user-space concept, while
PR or PRI – is the process’s actual priority, as seen by the Linux kernel.

3.
How To Calculate PR or PRI Values
Total number of priorities = 140
Real time priority range(PR or PRI):  0 to 99 
User space priority range: 100 to 139
Nice value range (NI): -20 to 19

PR = 20 + NI ->
PR = 20 + (-20 to + 19) ->
PR = 20 -20  to 20 + 19 ->
PR = 0 to 39 which is same as 100 to 139.
But if you see a rt rather than a number as shown in the screenshot below, it basically means the process is running under real-time scheduling priority.

default niceness of a process is set to 0 (which results in the priority value of 20)
